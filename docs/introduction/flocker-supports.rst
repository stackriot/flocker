List of Storage Backends
========================

Flocker allows you to use either shared storage, like Amazon EBS or EMC ScaleIO, or local storage for your applicationâ€™s storage layer.
The best option for you depends on a combination of factors including where you run your application and the capabilities you are trying to achieve.

For help determining which storage option is right for you, you will find a useful table in the `storage section of our About Flocker`_ page. 

The following backends can be used with Flocker.

ClusterHQ supported drivers:

* Amazon AWS EBS
* Anything that supports the OpenStack Cinder API
* Local storage using our ZFS driver (currently Experimental)

Community supported drivers:

* ConvergeIO
* Dell SC Series
* EMC ScaleIO
* EMC XtremIO
* Hedvig
* Huawei
* NetApp OnTap
* NexentaEdge
* Saratoga Speed
* VMware

Configuration details for each of the backends can be found in the :ref:`Configuring the Nodes and Storage Backends<agent-yml>` topic.

.. note:: If you wish to use a storage device that is not supported by Flocker or an existing plugin, you can implement this support yourself.
          For more information, see :ref:`contribute-flocker-driver`.
