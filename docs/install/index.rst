==================
Installing Flocker
==================

There are several installation options with which you can get up and running with Flocker.

You can also try Flocker without installation, either in our live hosted environment or on virtual machines using our Vagrant image. For more information, see :ref:`get-started`.

   :maxdepth: 3

   installer
   full-install

Once you have Flocker installed, you will need to complete the :ref:`post-installation-configuration`, starting with setting up authentication so the different parts of Flocker can communicate.

.. note:: If you're interested in developing Flocker (as opposed to simply using it) see :ref:`contribute`.
